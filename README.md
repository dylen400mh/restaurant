#Restaurant Page
This project is a simple restaurant page used to practice DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering the contents of the website using JavaScript, as well as utilizing Webpack to organize the code. Tabbed browsing is implemented to access the Contact and Menu pages.

Project Overview
The project consists of building a restaurant homepage using JavaScript to generate and manipulate the DOM elements. All of the website's content is dynamically created using JavaScript. This approach allows for the structure (HTML) to be separated from the behavior (JavaScript).

Tabbed browsing functionality to switch between different pages is set up with each tab's content placed in its own module, exported as a function that creates a styled div element and appends it to the DOM. The tab-switching logic will be implemented in the Website.js file, which is then called inside the index.js file, where event listeners will handle clearing the current contents and loading the appropriate tab module.
